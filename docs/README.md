## ‚ùì FAQ

### **Q: Can I edit a task after adding it?**
A: Currently, Piggy does not support editing tasks. You can delete the task and add a new one with the correct details.

### **Q: Where are my tasks stored?**
A: Tasks are stored in a file named `tasks.txt` in the same directory as the application.

### **Q: What happens if I close the application without typing `bye`?**
A: Piggy will still save your tasks, but it's always a good idea to use the `bye` command to ensure everything is saved properly.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Tasks are not saving**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the directory where Piggy is running.
- Check if the `tasks.txt` file exists. If not, Piggy will create it automatically.

### **Issue: Application crashes**
- Ensure you are using the correct command formats.
- If the issue persists, delete the `tasks.txt` file and restart the application.
